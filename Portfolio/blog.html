            Yesterday I learn the basics of git hub.
            I used the terminal to upload this portfolio to git hub.
            I found out that it was not hard like I though it would be.
            I you need to know is like 5 commands and they are all easy to remeber.
            I would recomand any one who want to learn git hub to learn it, but use the command promt or terminal.
