# Camden-Portfolio

Introduction:
This is my portfolio. Right now this is the only way you can see. I do not have it up on the web as of right now. I am posting this on github for many reasons. First reason is I can show people what I have done. Second reason is to get feed back from people like you. Just please read the table of contents before giving you advice, thanks. Also please do not change any of my code, read reason I do not want people to change my code for reasons. Last reason is to learn more about github and the terminal.

1. Please follow the rules.
2. Do not change my code
3. Every one is welcome.
4. Take this project seriously.
5. Be nice when right comments.

Reason I Do Not Want Peole To Change My Code:
